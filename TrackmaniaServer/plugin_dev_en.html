<h1>Plugin development for Fast 3.2.x</h1>

<p>It's not a complete documentation, but a basic explanation which
should permit to someone having a minimum php programming knowledge to
have some chance to understand how Fast and its plugins work. If you
want to understand, please read all !...

<p>If you make a plugin which could interest some other people, please
announce it on Fast/Dedimania forum, so you will be able to get some
advice, tests and feedbacks, or just some halp. If you want to, i can
put your plugins at the same place as Fast itself.

<p>
<h2>Plugin definition</h2>

<p>A plugin is just a php file in which is registered the plugin name,
this name will be the base name used by Fast to call the plugin
callbacks, most issued from the TM server callbacks or some Fast
specific events.

<p>You can use plugin.98.howto.php as a starting template. Plugins
must have a name like plugin.NN.xxxxxx.php, knowing that they will be
read in the plugins directory in alphanumerical order. Habitually the
same NN and xxxxxx are used than in what is explain after, but no
control is made. Btw, xxxxxx must be unique. In the file should appear:
<p><pre>registerPlugin('xxxxxx',NN);</pre>
<p>Once done, all functions <u>xxxxxxEventname(...)</u> will be
automatically called for associated events, in the NN order (so this
number can have a big impact in some case). Most events names are
understandable from their name or from the associated <a
href="http://kheops.unice.fr/slig/tmf/dedicated/ListCallbacks.html">server
callbacks</a>. Some others are purely Fast ones;
read <u>$_func_list</u> comments in fast_main.php (those which have a
<u>NeedChalSure</u> are eventually delayed until the map is surely
known, because <u>GetCurrentChallengeInfo</u> can be wrong in some
cases, and so if the script is just started the current map is
uncertain (this was a cause of false records in Fast2 for example).
<br>The event <u>xxxxxxInit()</u> is called at startup to permit to
all plugins to init themselves, in priority order, when all plugins files have already
been included.

<p>To see how events works/come, try to uncomment
<u>registerPlugin()</u> in plugin.98.howto.php , then launch Fast in a
terminal, so you will see the various events, which one is called in
which case, and in which order. Eventually add prints or parameters to
verify what is received in each case... To print, you can use
<u>Console("...")</u> or <u>debugPrint("....",$variable)</u> which
print also in the log file. You can also look the other existing
plugins (look preferably the last ones for simpler examples).

<p>Note: if you make global variables in your plugin, try to name them
$xxxxxx_nom (where xxxxxx is the plugin name), to avoid name
collisions with other plugins or future changes in Fast itself. Thanks.

<p>Note2: for some complex plugin, perhaps some changes should be made
in Fast files because else the plugin would be too complicated, or
because of some Fast or TM server bug. In such case contact me to look
at the problem and eventually make some Fast changes (post on
Dedimania/Fast forum, or PM me in tm-forum or Traxico Team forum)

<p>
<h2>Send a command to the TM server</h2>

<p>To send a method to the server (dedicated or not), use this function :
<pre>addCall(action,'TMServerMethod',...)</pre>
<ul>  action is null, true, login string, or action array :
    <li>null -> just log errors
    <li>true -> reject duplicate addCall method with same arguments
    <li>login string -> login of player who will get the error message if any
    <li>action array -> List of action which will be done when the response is received:
                <ul><li> 'Event'=>event_array
                    <li> 'Events'=>array(mixed delay_int and event_array)
                    <li> 'Call'=>array(action,call_array)
                    <li> 'Calls'=>array(mixed delay int and array(action,call_array))
                    <li> 'CB'=>callback: array(function_name, args_array [,num of arg to replace with response])
                    <li> 'Login'=>login string : same as action=login string
                    <li> 'DropDuplicate'=>boolean : if true then same as action=true
</ul></ul>
<br>The actions permit to do some automatic action when the reply is
received. It can be another method call, a function callback with the
reply content in the num-th parameter. This is for advanced use, most
time you will just use null, true or login

<p>'TMServerMethod' is a TM server method, see <a
href="http://kheops.unice.fr/slig/tmf/dedicated/ListMethods.html">TMF
dedicated methods</a>, or build yourself the method list of the used
server using the php script included in the dedicated archive. Note
that all ingame servers are more limited than dedicated ones.

<p>There are some other versions of this function (see
fast_general.php) : addCallArray(action,addcall_array) where
addcall_array is an array('TMServerMethod',...), and two versions
permetting to delay the call (milliseconds timeout) before sending it
to the server : addCallDelay(delay,action,'TMServerMethod',...) and addCallDelayArray(delay,action,addcall_array).


<p>
<h2>Available variables</h2>

<p>Some global variables are available and are normally kept up to
date automatically by Fast. Main ones come directly from the
corresponding server methods responses (exemple:
http://kheops.unice.fr/slig/tmu/xmlrpc/TMU-dedicated-2007-01-09.html
), and some are the same but with previous values (used to detect
changed values).
<p>A Fast game admin can use the chat command '/debug variable' to get
a print_r or the variable/array in the terminal and log, usefull to
see values at any time. Note: don't put the leading $ (exemple: /debug _players )

<p>Main are (see // Init variables in fast_main.php) :
<p><pre>$_Version, $_SystemInfos, $_ServerPackMask, $_Game
$_Status , $_old_Status, $_StatusCode
$_ServerOptions
$_GameInfos, $_NextGameInfos
$_NetworkStats, $_PlayerList, $_Ranking, $_PlayerInfo
$_ChallengeList, $_ChallengeInfo, $_NextChallengeInfo, $_old_ChallengeInfo
$_CurrentChallengeIndex, $_NextChallengeIndex
$_ForcedMods, $_ForcedMusic
$_GuestList, $_IgnoreList, $_BanList, $_BlackList
$_WarmUp
$_RoundCustomPoints
$_CallVoteRatios

$_CallVoteTimeOut

$_guest_list, $_ignore_list, $_ban_list, $_black_list
$_bills
$_map_control
$_BestChecks, $_BestChecksName, $_IdealChecks
$_NumberOfChecks

$_players, $_teams, $_players_positions
$_players_round_current, $_players_actives, $_players_spec, $_players_finished
$_players_firstmap, $_players_round_time

$_roundspoints_rule
$_roundslimit_rule
$_ml_vote_ask
$_autorestart_map
$_autorestart_newmap

$_debug
$_mldebug
</pre>
<p>Direct use of $_PlayerList, $_Ranking and $_PlayerInfo should be
avoided : instead use $_players, which is an associative array with
logins as index, include all there values, and include also many info
used by Fast and plugins ($_players is made and kept up to date by
plugin plugin.01.players.php which is mandatory and must stay the 1st plugin).

<p><pre>$_debug : debug level which change what will be written in the
        log. It's not always really logical... consider than 3 will be enough 
        most time to understand and debug.
$_mldebug : debug level used in manialink related plugins
$_Game : 'TMU' (Forever, both United and Nations, are considered as TMU)
$_currentTime : current time in milliseconds
$_players_round_current : current round number in game (Rounds and Team modes)
$_players_actives : number of active players
$_players_spec : number of specs
$_players_finished : number of player having finished (Rounds, Team and Laps modes)
$_players_positions : array with live infos about players order in current round
</pre>

<p>There are many other global variables, plugin specific, or too much
specific to try to document all here : you will have to search in the
plugins...  :p

<p>
<h2>Send translated text in the player game language</h2>

<p>Game language of each player is indicated in the TM server infos
only for TMU, so except if the language is choosed manually by the
player, it's nearly useless for older TM games.

<p>How it works : all the locale.xxxxx.xml.txt file are read and
parsed, and must have a xml struct like: 
<p><pre>&lt;fast&gt;&lt;locale&gt;&lt;language&gt;&lt;tag&gt;sprintf like string text&lt;/tag&gt;&lt;/language&gt;&lt;/locale&gt;&lt;/fast&gt;</pre>
<p>there can be set or not several languages, 'language' is 'en',
'fr', etc. and have to be one of the existing Translations name of the
game. There can be one or more 'tag', each one being the name used in
locale functions to get the wanted la translation. The functions
parameters after the tag will be passed as sprintf parameters, so the
translation string can use them with %d, %f, %s etc. in correct order
(so in the xml please add the string parameters in any !)

<p>localeText() and localeTextArray() return a string, which can be
sent to a player using addCall('ChatSendToLogin','text','login') or
addCall('ChatSendServerMessageToLogin','text','login').
localeTextArray() permit to create a translation composed of several
parts as string to translate, simple string, nomber etc. which will
be concatenated, which can make a code nicer than several localeText()
concatenated. Tags are translated according to the indicated payer
language, and if the tag don't exist in the player language it is
searched in the default language one ('en' in the default Fast config).
<p><pre>// get localized string using login language
//   localeText($login,$tag,...)
// set login to null if not related to a player
// tag is the searched tag in the locale file
// other params are sprintf like params
localeText($login,$string)

// get localized string using login language
//   localeTextArray($login,array($tag,...))
// set login to null if not related to a player
// tag is the searched tag in the locale file
// other params in the array are sprintf like params
localeTextArray($login,$string_tag_array)
</pre>

<p>multiLocaleText() (tmu only) is a litle more complex, it does not return a
string but an array in the
ChatSendToLanguage()/ChatSendServerMessageToLanguage() needed
format. It will permit to send easily a message to all players, in the
right language for each player when available, and else in default language.

<p><pre>// get localized array for ChatSendToLanguage TM method for all used languages
//   multiLocaleText(mixed,mixed,...)
// all mixed are concatenated, each mixed can be :
// - an array($tag,...) , where tag is the searched tag in the locale file, and
//   other params in the array are sprintf like params
// - any other value will just be concatenated
multiLocaleText($string_tag_array,...)
</pre>

<h2>Manialinks</h2>

<p>New in Forever, manialinks now take an id and can be drawn/updated/erased
separately ! With also the new look and predifined styles and icons,
we will see soon very nice things, sure !  :)

<p>Fast has fully changed the way manialinks are handled, and it's
probably simplier. 
<br>The plugin.10.manialinks.php work is to send to the server the needed methods
to draw/hide/erase every individual manialink to each player easily. Only
a manialink which content have really changed will be sent.

<p>All usefull functions are in plugin.10.manialinks.php !
<br>The best is to look at the beginning of plugin.10.manialinks.php
file, then look and try the ml_howto plugin...

<br>Btw, the use of manialinks need first to know how to write a manialink xml string.
Next will only explain how to make it work with Fast.

<p>New functions manialinksShow(), manialinksShowForce() and
manialinksHide() permit to drive things.
You have to give a name id to you manialink, some optional infos,
the xml string itself (whithout the "&lt;manialink ...&gt;" and
"&lt;/manialink ...&gt;" tags), and the login of target (or true
for all), and it will be made. The functions manialinksAddId() etc.
should be used to create the id from name id, but using
manialinksShow() will create it automatically if it does not exist.

<p>Functions manialinksAddAction() etc. permit to create an id to use in
action=''. You give it a name (must be unique, so use extensions
based on your plugin name) and it return a id number. You can
use the id number directly, or using the id name and the global array
like $_ml_act[$action_idname].

<p>xxxPlayerManialinkPageAnswer() events now include the id name of
the clicked action and not only the id number (if the number was
created using manialinksAddAction() function).

<p>Any plugin should consider to draw what is needed for it when the
events xxxPlayerConnect() and xxxPlayerShowML(,xxx,1) are received.

<p><p>Function manialinksGetHudPartControl() permit to take control of
some game hud part (just because only one plugin should play which one
hud part to avoid problems), then using manialinksHideHudPart() and
manialinksShowHudPart() is possible.

<p>Be carrefull : Fast manialinks are sent individually for each
player. Be sure to limit the size of your manialink and freqency of
changes.

<p>For debuging, try to increase $_mldebug (see fast.php) to 5 or
more, to get logs about what manialink id is sent to who, and its byte size.

<h2>Special manialink used for records</h2>
Fast also include in plugin.16.ml_times.php a special
manialink permitting to show other thing than records, but at the same
place. If you want to use it, you can loo, at 2 plugins to see how it
works : plugin.18.ml_records.php and plugin.90.ktlc.php. Mainly, it
need to add a callback using ml_timesAddTimesMod(), remove it using 
ml_timesRemoveTimesMod(), and return an array of the right form when
the callback is called.

<pre>
// Add a callback to draw times (or other) in records place
function ml_timesAddTimesMod($name,$hook,$data)

// remove a callback added with ml_timesAddTimesMod()
function ml_timesRemoveTimesMod($name)
</pre>

The callback ($hook) has the form :
callbackname($login,&$data,$num,$min){} , where:
$data is the data given previously to the function ml_timesAddTimesMod(), 
$num is the number of visible entries in the player panel, 
$min is the minimum number of entries to return.
It must return an array ($table in the example) containing :
<ul>
<li>some entries $table[xx] =
array('Pos'=>'...','Name'=>'...','Time'=>'...'), with numerical
indexes xx from 0 to yy (yy between $min-1 and $num-1). Values for
'Pos','Name' and 'Time' will be visibles in the 3 columns for each
entry (so they must be in text format comptatible with manialink, and
with compatible width because column width are fixed).
<li>an entry $table['Name'] = '...' giving the panel title.
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Various functions</h2>

<p>Most usefull functions are in fast_general.php (well many are
probably of no use in plugins). Here are some of them:

<p><pre>// formats a time: 1200000 -> 2:00.00
MwTimeToString($MwTime,$msec=true)

// formats a time: -12340 -> -12.34
MwDiffTimeToString($DiffTime)

// Remove colors from strings : $s$fffhello -> hello
stripColors($str)

// Remove links $h $l from strings.  if not force then remove links only if game is known 
//  and not TMU (ie which don't support the links)
stripLinks($str,$force=false)

// return a string with Player name, used for beginning of chat line
authorChat($author)

// verify if login is in admin list
verifyAdmin($login)

// Verify than 'Login' in given array is really of type string and convert them is needed
// because there are problems with pure numeric logins seen as int
loginToString(&$response,$level)
</pre>
<p>
<p>
<p><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>You can use some <a
href="http://kheops.unice.fr/slig/tmu/xmlrpc/rpc_utilities.zip">utilities
xmlrpc for php</a> which can help you to make tests about
commands/methods of TM servers, and for TMU using a dedicated server
test ingame manialinks, and so verify layout befoire trying to make it
in a plugin


<p><br>Good luck  ;)
